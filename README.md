# Horror Icons Word Guess Game

This is a relatively simple "hangman"-style word guess game that does several things:

1. Provides users with a hint of the word they are guessing in the form of a picture.
2. Shows users the number of letters in the word they are guessing (using underscores).
3. Replaces underscores with correct letters that the user has guessed.
4. Displays incorrect letters that the user has guessed.
5. Increase a "Wins" number if the user correctly guesses the word.
6. Displays the previously-guessed correct answer to the user.

## Technologies Used

For this game, I used HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The reason for making this game was to help me learn the basics of vanilla JavaScript and further my understanding of JS logic, variables, and functions.
